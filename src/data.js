			"To prepare crust add graham crackers to a food processor and process until you reach fine crumbs. Add melted butter and pulse 3-4 times to coat crumbs with butter.",

			"Next, add the gelatine and water to a small mixing bowl and mix to combine. Microwave for 30 seconds.",
			"Add the cream cheese to the marshmallow mixture and use a hand mixer or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment to mix until smooth.",
			"Add the warm cream and melted gelatin mixture and mix until well combined.",
			"Add 1/3 of the mixture to a mixing bowl, add purple food gel and mix until well combined. Colour 1/3 of the mixture blue. Split the remaining mixture into two mixing bowls, colour one pink and leave the other white.",
			"Pour half the purple cheesecake mixture into the chill tart crust. Add half the blue and then add the remaining purple and blue in the tart tin.
